Places, for the reporting of decennial census data, include census
designated places, consolidated cities, and incorporated places.  
Each place is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) code, based on the alphabetical order of the place
name within each state.  If place names are duplicated within a state 
and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is 
assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which 
each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, 
alphabetically by their legal description (for example, "city" 
before "village").  

There are technically six categories of "incorporated place" by the 
U.S. Census: city, borough, city and borough, municipality, town, 
and village.  In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and 
Virginia) there are one or more incorporated places known as 
"independent cities" that are primary divisions of a state and 
legally not part of any county (i.e. Baltimore City).  Puerto 
Rico has a different scheme with two categories: "zona urbana" 
and "comunidad".  

Census designated places (CDP's) are concentrations of population,
housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but
are not within an incorporated place.  CDP boundaries may change 
with each decennial census.
