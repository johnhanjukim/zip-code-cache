<h1>CENSUS 2000 GEOGRAPHIC TERMS AND CONCEPTS</h1>

<p>
(All definitions were extracted from the United States Census
Bureau's, Summary File 1 Technical Documentation, Appendix A and the
Decennial Management Division Glossary, April 1999)
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> Address
  <dd> The house number and street name or other designation assigned
       to a housing unit, special place, business establishment, or
       other structure for purposes of mail delivery or to allow
       emergency services, delivery people, and visitors to find the
       structure.  See basic street address, city-style address, E-911
       address, fire number, house number and street name address,
       location description, mailing address, and non-city-style
       address. </dd>

  <dt> Block
  <dd> Census blocks are areas bounded on all sides by visible
       features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks,
       and by invisible boundaries, such as city, town, township, and
       county limits, property lines, and short, imaginary extensions
       of streets and roads.  Generally, census blocks are small in
       area; for example, a block bounded by city streets. However,
       census blocks in sparsely settled areas may contain many square
       miles of territory. </dd>
  <dd> All territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island
       Areas has been assigned block numbers, as was the case for the
       1990 census.  To improve operational efficiency and geographic
       identifications, the U.S. Census Bureau has introduced
       different numbering systems for tabulation blocks used in
       decennial census data products, and for collection blocks, used
       in administering the census.  (In 1990, there generally was a
       single numbering system.)  Collection block numbers are
       available only in the TIGER/Line data products; the U.S. Census
       Bureau does not tabulate data for collection blocks. </dd>
  <dd> Tabulation blocks do not cross the boundaries of any entity for
       which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data, including American
       Indian areas, Alaska Native areas, Hawaiian home lands, census
       tracts, congressional districts, counties, county subdivisions,
       places, state legislative districts, urban and rural areas,
       school districts, voting districts, and ZIP Code tabulation
       areas (ZCTAs). Tabulation blocks also generally do not cross
       the boundaries of certain landmarks, including military
       installations, national parks, and national monuments.
       Tabulation blocks are identified uniquely within census tract
       by means of a four-digit number.  (The 1990 census block
       numbers had three digits, with a potential alphabetic suffix.) 
       The Census 2000 collection blocks are numbered uniquely within
       county (or statistically equivalent entity), and consist of
       four or five digits.  For its Census 2000 data tabulations, the 
       U.S. Census Bureau created a unique set of census block numbers
       seen in the data presentations.  For the 1990 census, the
       U.S. Census Bureau created a separate block with a suffix of
       "Z". Census Bureau as associated with the home port of the
       vessel.</dd>

  <dt> Block Boundary
  <dd> A census map feature, visible (street, road, stream, shoreline,
       and so forth) or non-visible (county line, city limit, property
       line, and so forth), that delimits a census block.  Two or more
       features usually delimit a block, but a single feature may
       delimit a block in the case of an island or a circular street.
       A boundary generally must include at least one addressable
       feature, that is, a feature that can have an address assigned
       to it.  The boundary of a state or county is always a block
       boundary. </dd>
