<h1>Calculating from Latitude and Longitude</h1>

<h3>By John Kim &lt;john.kim3@gmail.com&gt;</h3>

<p>
The zip code database provides latitude and longitude for the rough center of each zip code.  The trick is to calculate distance and direction to any other zip code.
</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>
To start with finding the distance between two points on the globe, we determine the positions of those points in arbitrary coordinates of X, Y, and Z.  Here Z is parallel to the axis of the Earth and X and Y are arbitrarily based on the origin of the longitude system. Assuming the Earth is a sphere, the positions are: 
<pre>
Zip Code A is at latitude LatA and longitude LngA
    x_A = R*cos(LatA)*cos(LngA)
    y_A = R*cos(LatA)*sin(LngA)
    z_A = R*sin(LatA)

Zip Code B is at latitude LatB and longitude LngB
    x_B = R*cos(LatB)*cos(LngB)
    y_B = R*cos(LatB)*sin(LngB)
    z_B = R*sin(LatB)

where R is the radius of the Earth.  
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The radius of the Earth is actually not a constant, because the Earth is
actually an ellipsoid rather than a sphere.  The radius is 0.3% shorter
at the poles than at the equator, a difference of some 21.3 kilometers.
For distances within the country, you should use the equatorial radius
or (if you want to be more precise) the radius at the average latitude
in question.  
<pre>
Radius at the equator = 6378137 meters
Radius at the poles =   6356752 meters

Radius at any latitude = 6378137 * (1 - 0.0033493*sin(Lat)^2)

Average Radius between two latitudes = 6378137 * (1 - 0.0033493*sin((LatA+LatB)/2)^2)
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Distance</h2>

<p>
The real distance between the points is the arc along the globe.
This is based on finding the angle between the two vectors, which is 
found from the "dot product".  The distance along the arc is equal
to the angle (in radians) times the radius (using the average radius
defined above).  If <tt>Ang</tt> is the true angle between the points, 
</p>
<pre>
R*R*cos(Ang) = x_A*x_B + y_A*y_B + z_A*z_B

cos(Ang) = cos(LatA)*cos(LngA)*cos(LatB)*cos(LngB)
           + cos(LatA)*sin(LngA)*cos(LatB)*sin(LngB)
           + sin(LatA)*sin(LatB)

cos(Ang) = cos(LatA)*cos(LngA)*cos(LatB)*cos(LngB)
           + cos(LatA)*sin(LngA)*cos(LatB)*sin(LngB)
           + sin(LatA)*sin(LatB)

cos(Ang) = cos(LatA)*cos(LatB)*(cos(LngA)*cos(LngB) + sin(LngA)*sin(LngB)) + sin(LatA)*sin(LatB)

distance = radius * Ang

</pre>
</p>

<p>
The above calculation works, and is likely to be used by generalized
packages.  However, by going through some simple math we can simplify
the calculation so that it can be calculated more accurately and in 
fewer steps.  
<pre>
 [using the general relation cos(a-b)=cos(a)*cos(b)+sin(a)*sin(b)]

cos(Ang) = cos(LatA)*cos(LatB)*(cos(LngA-LngB)) + sin(LatA)*sin(LatB)

cos(Ang) = (cos(LngA-LngB)-1+1)*cos(LatA)*cos(LatB) + sin(LatA)*sin(LatB)

 [use the general relation cos(a-b)=cos(a)*cos(b)+sin(a)*sin(b)]

cos(Ang) = (cos(LngA-LngB)-1)*cos(LatA)*cos(LatB) + cos(LatA)*cos(LatB) + sin(LatA)*sin(LatB)

cos(Ang) = (cos(LngA-LngB)-1)*cos(LatA)*cos(LatB) + cos(LatA-LatB)

Ang = arccos( (cos(LngA-LngB)-1)*cos(LatA)*cos(LatB) + cos(LatA-LatB) )
</pre>

<h2>Computerized Implementation</h2>

<p>
The above works fine as a mathematical relation, and it has simplified 
the number of steps to a fair minimum.  There are two concerns for 
this as a computerized calculation, though: 
<ul>
  <li> For points which are close together on the globe, both
       <tt>cos(LngA-LngB)</tt> and <tt>cos(LatA-LatB)</tt> are close
       to 1.  The program only stores a finite number of digits,
       so if <tt>x</tt> is very small, then <tt>(x+1-1)</tt> may lose 
       precision compared to the original <tt>x</tt>.  In the above
       relation, there are two such operations which lose precision.  
       </li>
  <li> The above uses many trigonometric operations, which are usually
       about x4 to x6 times slower than simple arithmatic operations
       in most programming languages.  If you want to do a lot of
       calculations, the above can be inefficient. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The solution for these problems depends on how you are using the
calculation.  If processsing speed is not important, you can just
retain a very large number of places to be sure of accuracy.
However, there is also a good approximation which can be made for
points which are close together.  
</p>

<pre>
For small x, sin(x) ~   x - (x^3/6) + ...
             cos(x) ~ 1 - (x^2/2) + (x^4/24) - ...

So assuming we keep only the x squared term, this means: 

1 - Ang^2/2 = (1-(LngA-LngB)^2/2-1)*cos(LatA)*cos(LatB) + 1 - (LatA-LatB)^2/2

Ang^2 = cos(LatA)*cos(LatB)*((LngA-LngB)^2) + (LatA-LatB)^2

Ang = sqrt(  cos(LatA)*cos(LatB)*((LngA-LngB)^2) + (LatA-LatB)^2  )
</pre>

<p>
The above relation is good up to <tt>x^4</tt> power, which for many 
purposes is pretty good.
